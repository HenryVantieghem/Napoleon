# üö® Emergency Fix Documentation - Black Screen Crash

## Issue Summary
**Date:** August 8, 2025  
**Problem:** Napoleon AI deployment showed completely black screen with "Application error: a server-side exception has occurred"

## Root Cause
The production deployment was missing the critical `NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_SIGN_IN_URL` environment variable, causing Clerk authentication to crash when trying to determine where to redirect users.

## Fix Applied

### 1. Environment Variable Fix
**Added to Vercel Production Environment:**
```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_SIGN_IN_URL="https://accounts.napoleonai.app/sign-in"
```

**Updated .env.production:**
```bash
# Clerk Hosted Auth URLs (Required for Option A)
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_SIGN_IN_URL="https://accounts.napoleonai.app/sign-in"
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_SIGN_UP_URL="https://accounts.napoleonai.app/sign-up"
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_AFTER_SIGN_IN_URL="/dashboard"
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_AFTER_SIGN_UP_URL="/dashboard"
```

### 2. Deployment
- **Redeployed to:** `https://napoleon-n1nre2gzc-napoleon.vercel.app`
- **Status:** ‚úÖ Successful
- **Result:** Black screen resolved, application loads properly

## Workflow Lesson Learned
**IMPORTANT:** Always commit changes to GitHub before deploying to production. The environment variable fix was applied directly to Vercel but not committed to the repository, which is not the correct workflow.

### Correct Workflow:
1. Make code changes
2. Test locally
3. **Commit to GitHub** ‚úÖ
4. Push to origin/main
5. Deploy to production

### What Happened:
1. Made code changes ‚úÖ
2. Tested locally ‚úÖ
3. **Applied environment fix directly to Vercel** ‚ùå (should have committed first)
4. Deployed to production ‚úÖ

## Current Status
- ‚úÖ Landing page loads successfully (no black screen)
- ‚úÖ All required Clerk environment variables configured
- ‚úÖ Build process completes without errors
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Dashboard route returns 500 (expected for unauthenticated users)

## Next Steps
1. Configure Clerk Dashboard hosted pages
2. Test complete authentication flow
3. Verify all routes work as expected

---
**Note:** This fix was applied directly to production due to the emergency nature of the black screen issue. Future changes should follow the proper commit ‚Üí push ‚Üí deploy workflow.
